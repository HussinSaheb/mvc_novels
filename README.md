# novel updates
This project is a novel sharing website using the rMVC design pattern with Ruby
### Resources
Each novel is a resource. However, for this project I'll be focusing on implementing a single novel. The quantity of posts will be the chapters of the said novel followed by a small description of what the chapter is.
