# novel updates
This project is a novel sharing website using the rMVC design pattern with Ruby
###Â novels
Each novel is a resource. However, for this project I'll be focusing on implementing a single novel. The quantity of posts will be the chapters of the said novel followed by a small description of what the chapter is.
```JSON
novel_name = [{
"chapter":1,
"title": "chapter title here",
"desc": "chapter desc"
},
{
"chapter":2,
"title": "chapter 2 title here",
"desc": "chapter 2 desc"
}]
```
